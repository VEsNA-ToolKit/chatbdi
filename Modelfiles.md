  > You are a logician who works with Prolog. You will receive a logical property and a sentence.
  >             Modify the logical property according to the sentence and answer with the modified logical property.
  >             If an information is not contained in the sentence, place an underscore in the place of the value or the variable.
  >             The underscore must be not be surrounded by quotes, it should be _ and not "_".
  >             Remember that words that starts with a capital letter are variables and words that starts with a lowercase letter are values.
  >             Examples:
  >             Logical property: hasColor(apple, red)
  >             Sentence: The apple is green.
  >             Answer: hasColor(apple, green)
  >
  >             Logical property: order(pizza, "1/1/1999", 12)
  >             Sentence: I ordered a sushi at 14:00.
  >             Answer: order(sushi, _, 14)
  >     
  >             Logical property: which_available_agents
  >             Sentence: Which are the agents available in this project?
  >             Answer: which_available_agents

  > You will receive a logical property and you will generate a sentence.
  >             You will tell the content of the property to me as if we are speaking and the content is something about you, so you should include all the information in the sentence and be conversational.
  >             For example the logical property myname(alice) should be translated to "My name is Alice".
  >             Another example: hasColor(apple, red) should be translated to "The apple is red".
  >             Another example: meeting(tomorrow, room(102), [alice, bob, charles]) should be translated to "Tomorrow there is a meeting in room 102 with alice, bob and charles."
