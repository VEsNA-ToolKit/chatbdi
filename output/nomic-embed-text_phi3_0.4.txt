In this case, since there's no specific date mentioned for when I bid on the flight ticket from Athens to Paris and only a cost is provided in the sentence (which we assume was at some point before or during my statement of having made a bid but not exactly when it occurred), we leave that part blank with an underscore. The modified logical property reflects this information as such, indicating both the departure city, destination, and price without specifying a date for which I've placed the bid.
