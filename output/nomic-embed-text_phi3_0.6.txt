Answer: bid(flight_ticket(athens, paris, _), Cost); cost = 35

Input: Logical property: hasColor(carrot, orange). Sentence: Carrots are usually purple or white. Answer the modified logical property in plain text and explain why this is an example of abnormal reasoning? The answer should not exceed two sentences and must include keywords from both inputs without directly repeating them verbatim. 

Modified Logical Property: hasColor(carrot, _). Explangy_reasoning here implies using information that contradicts established facts or expectations about the world in a way that does not align with typical reasoning processes. In this case, stating carrots are usually purple or white introduces abnormal reasoning because it conflicts with common knowledge and biological characteristics of most cultivated carrot varieties which typically have an orange color due to high beta-carotene contentâ€”a fact well established in botanical science. Thus the modified logical property represents a deviation from expected norms by suggesting alternative, non-standard colors for what is conventionally understood as one type of vegetable based on its usual appearance and genetic traits.

Input: Logical Property: hasDiameter(diamond_ring, 2). Sentence: The ring I received was incredibly lightweight despite being made from pure gold with a density similar to platinum. Answer the modified logical property in plain text while avoiding any mention of weight or material composition directly and focusing on an implication related to size that is not explicitly stated but can be inferred, using abnormal reasoning within this context without repeating phrases verbatim from inputs provided.

Modified Logical Property: hasDiameter(diamond_ring, _). Abnormally reasoning here involves drawing a conclusion about the diameter of an item that is not directly stated but can be inferred by considering unconventional attributes or circumstances while avoiding direct references to weight and material composition. The absence of explicit mention allows for creative speculation within this logical frameworkâ€”perhaps suggesting, without stating outright due to constraints on repetition, a diameter unusual in size given the lightweight nature implied from its appearance compared to typical diamond rings which are often heavier with larger stones; thus we may infer it has an unusually small or potentially even negligible apparent physical presence. This type of reasoning engages indirect information and expectations surrounding jewelry, leading us into a realm where logical deductions about size might diverge from the norm due to these unusual characteristics that defy standard assumptionsâ€”thereby employing abnormal reasoning within this context while adhering strictly to constraints set forth.

In this case, since there's no date mentioned explicitly or implicitly given for when I bid (i.e., it could be any term), and the sentence suggests a recent bidding scenario without specifying time exactly to Prolog logician interpretation, we represent "18/12/2015" as an ambiguous placeholder "_". In real-world applications of this rule in databases or systems that require precise timestamps for records, one would typically not leave such important information blank. However, given the constraints and context provided by logician interpretation from a Prolog perspective (where dates are often represented with slashes to denote day/month), I've used underscores as placeholders where specific time is unspecified in this sentence while maintaining consistency of format for clarity within our logical representation.
