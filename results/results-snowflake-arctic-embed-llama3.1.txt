[USER] "John is the father of Sarah." 
[EMBED] owns(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `parent_of(X, Y) :- father(X, Y), male(X).`

Note: I'm assuming a basic first-order logic representation where `owns/2` has been replaced with `parent_of/2`, and a separate predicate `father/2` is used to represent the relationship between parents. The modified property also includes an additional constraint that the parent must be male (`male/1`).
