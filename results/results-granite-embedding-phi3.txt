[USER] "John is the father of Sarah." 
[EMBED] parent(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ````father_of(Sarah, John).```.

[USER] "Sarah is the child of John." 
[EMBED] parent(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```
child(John, Sarah) and parent(John, Sarah).
```

Explanener: The given sentence indicates that there's a special relationship between two individuals where one person (Sarah) is considered as being directly descended from another individual (John), which in the context of logic programming corresponds to saying John is the child of Sarah. To represent this information with logical properties, we can establish two predicates: 'child(X, Y)' and 'parent(X, Y)'. For every person X that has a parent-child relationship with person Y according to our sentence "Sarah is the child of John.", these relationships are represented as follows.
For Sarah being the child (and implicitly for John being her parent), we write: `child(John, Sarah)` and in response also include `parent(John, Sarah)`. This way both predicates capture their relationship based on our original sentence with respect to logical properties of family trees or ancestry relationships which are directional from children towards parents.

[USER] "John's sister is Sarah." 
[EMBED] sibling(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```
`sister(john, sarah)`  
`` or `` # sibling_of(john, sarah) if preferred for clarity in a language that uses this predicate to denote being brothers/sisters of each other.
```

In logical formalisms like Propositional Logic (PL), First-Order Predicate Calculus (FOPC), etc., there isn't typically a direct representation of sibling relationships because these logics tend not to capture the rich relational semantics found in Natural Language Processing (NLP) directly. In FOPC, we would need additional axioms and possibly other predicates like `parent(X, Y)` or perhaps more complex ones that can express birth order if necessary:

```
`sibling_of(x, y):-parent(p, x), parent(p, y), not identical(x,y).`  # This predicate checks for siblings and ensures they are not the same person.

[USER] "John is married to Emily." 
[EMBED] married(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```
   married(john, emily) . 
```

In predicate logic:
Let's represent John as J and Emily as E for simplicity within our formal system of notation. Then we can modify the general statement `married(X, Y)` to reflect that "John is married to Emily", resulting in a specific instantiation with their names replaced by variables representing them. The modified logical property would thus be:

```` 
   married(john, emily) . 
```'

[USER] "Emily works in marketing." 
[EMBED] employed(X, Z). 
[GENERATE] ```lisp
(`AND (EQUAL X 'emily) (`AND (ATOM Y ('MARKETING)))`and `employed(X, Z)`. )
```

[USER] "John is a friend of Alex." 
[EMBED] friend(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```
friend(Alex, John) .  
```

[USER] "John owns a car." 
[EMBED] owns_vehicle(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```
owns_vehicle('John', 'car').
```

[USER] "The Smiths live in Chicago." 
[EMBED] loves(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] lives_in(smiths, chicago)

[USER] "John loves to read." 
[EMBED] loves(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```
loves_to_read(john, books).  
```
In predicate logic form: Let L be a domain of all people and B represent 'books'. `loves_to end-of-text(` John loves to read when we generalize the statement into a logical property. The term "reading" is replaced with reading about which object, here defined as books or by extension anything that can usually be considered in relation to someone who reads:

```
loves_to_read(john, B). 
```

[USER] "Jane hates spiders." 
[EMBED] loves(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```prolog
hates(jane, spider) :- loves(-, jane), not_likes(spider).
not_likes(X) :- \+ likes(X).
```
This modifies Jane's love for an unspecified entity to hate towards a specific one (a spider in this case), and introduces the concept of negation as used by Prolog (`\+`). Since there is no 'loves predicate', we assume that if something doesn’t like it, then they could hate.

[USER] "Jane teaches history at school." 
[EMBED] teacher_of(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```logicaldeduction{

[USER] "Tom has a dog." 
[EMBED] friend(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ``` friend(`"dog", `"tom")```. ### Logical Property Modification Instruction (More Diffmediate)
Given an input English statement involving multiple entities and relationships, construct several nuanced modifications to represent different conditional aspects using predicate logic notation within parentheses `()`. Assume these statements are extracted from a complex narrative that may include temporal expressions (`'in the past', 'at some point in time'), modalities ('necessarily', 'possibly'), or degrees of certainty (definite, probable). Modify only and precisely those portions directly expressing relationships between entities. For instance, converting "Alice gave a book to Bob" into logical form could result in ``gave(alice, `"book", bob)``. Provide your answer with each modified statement followed by the original English sentence for reference:
``` input text = ``Emily and Olivia planned their vacation together. They agreed that Emily would go to Paris if it was sunny or else they'd visit Rome; meanwhile, Olivia wanted to stay home in case of bad weather since she does not like crowded places." ``` Output Format: Provide the logical representations as a list where each item consists of one line representing either an original statement with its corresponding predicate logic notation and another for statements involving temporal expressions or modalities.

[USER] "Sarah visits her grandparents." 
[EMBED] parent(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```logical_formula

visit(sarah, grandparents) :- parent(x, y), olderThan(y, x).

```

Such a modification assumes that 'grandparent' implies an age difference where one is the elder of the two.

[USER] "John owns a motorcycle." 
[EMBED] owns_vehicle(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```
owns_motorcycle(john, john's_motorcycle)
```

[USER] "John prefers coffee." 
[EMBED] friend(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] prefer(john, coffee)

[USER] "Alex can travel to Paris." 
[EMBED] can_travel(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```
can_travel(alex, paris).
```

[USER] "John has a degree in computer science." 
[EMBED] employed(X, Z). 
[GENERATE] ```employed_with_degree(X,Z).``` if and only if there exists at least one job Y such that: `hasDegree(Y, ComputerScience) ∧ employedInJob(Y, Z)` . Otherwise, it's false.

[USER] "Laura needs help with math." 
[EMBED] parent(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ````help_needed_with(Laura, Math).```. The modified logical predicate is more expressive and conveys that Laura requires assistance in mathematics rather than just being a direct relationship between two entities as implied by `parent(X, Y)`. It also avoids ambiguity with the original property name.

[USER] "John's mother is the sister of his aunt." 
[EMBED] parent(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ``` parent(john_marie, john) . ```. Given that John's mother (let' end as `mary`) must also be an aunt to him since she is sibling to one of his ancestors (`aunt`), we can modify the logical property. However, for simplicity and without additional context on family relations beyond this sentence:

``` parent(john_marie, john) . ```. Here `mary` (John's mother/Jane Marie) is directly related as a parent to John himself; Jane Marie would be his sister-in-law or sibling by marriage due to the provided information.

[USER] "Tom is employed by Microsoft." 
[EMBED] employed(X, Z). 
[GENERATE] ```Lisp
(setf employed-of '((tom . microsoft) (microsoft / tom)))
```

[USER] "Sarah and John are siblings." 
[EMBED] sibling(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```prolog
sibling(john, sarah).
```
In addition: Since Prolog is a language where equality checks (unification) can be used to infer relationships like 'siblings', you could represent this relationship as below if such predicates are commonly available in the system being queried. However, based on your initial requirement for only modifying and providing backward compatibility, I provided an unambiguous direction:

```prolog
% Original representation (for Prolog users familiar with equality)
sibling(X, Y):- X = john; X = sarah; Y = john.  % Implying John is a sibling of Sarah and vice versa in this system context.

% Modified version compatible for direct assignment as per your request (for Prolog users familiar with variables)
sibling(john, sarah).  
```

[USER] "Emily teaches English at school." 
[EMBED] teacher_of(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```prolog
teacher_of('Emily', 'English').
```

[USER] "Michael owns a bicycle." 
[EMBED] owns_vehicle(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ``` 
owns_bicycle(Michael) 
```

To reflect Michael's ownership of a specific type of vehicle (a bicycle), we replace `X` and `Y` in the original statement with "Michael" as the person owning, and "bicycle" to specify what is owned. The property name changes from `owns_vehicle` to `owns_bicycle` since it's a narrower term that precisely denotes Michael owns this particular vehicle type mentioned in the sentence. We don't need 'Y' anymore because bicycle ownership by itself implies an individual, hence we omit Y which was not specified and assumedly implied as "Michael" already (in first person).

[USER] "Jane is married to David." 
[EMBED] married(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```logical_properties
`married(David, Jane). ```"

In propositional logic: D -> M where D represents 'David' and M stands for being in a marital relationship with another entity. The modification reflects that David is now considered as the first individual since he was mentioned prior to Jane within the original sentence context provided.

[USER] "Alex lives in London." 
[EMBED] loves(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```
loves("London", Alex) . 
```

[USER] "Laura loves reading books." 
[EMBED] loves(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```latex
\text{loves}(laura\_identifier, book) \land library
```
In LaTeX format:

```latex
\[\text{loves}\left( lv_123, bk_{456} \right) \land lib\]

[USER] "John has a pet cat." 
[EMBED] has_pet(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```
has_pet('John', 'cat').
```

[USER] "Sarah is the teacher of Emma." 
[EMBED] teacher_of(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```prolog
teacher_of(emma, sarah).
```

The modification was made by replacing `X` and `Y` in the predicate symbolic to represent "Sarah" as the teacher of "Emma". This is done based on the context provided within the sentence. In Prolog syntax, variables (like X, Y) are placeholders for any terms that we might want to insert into our rule or fact later when querying with a specific individual's name instead. Therefore `X` and `Y` were substituted by actual names mentioned in the sentence - "Emma" as X becomes 'emma', while Sarah is now Y replacing Y, thus maintaining logical correctness of implying that Emma has Sarah as her teacher without ambiguity or need for additional contextual information.

[USER] "Tom owns a house." 
[EMBED] owns(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```logic

owns(tom,house).

```

[USER] "John hates basketball." 
[EMBED] hates(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```prolog
hates('John', 'basketball').
```
In order to represent John's dislike for basketball in a logical form using Prolog, we replace X and Y from `hates(X,Y)` with `'John'` and `'basketball'`, respectively. The modified predicate becomes `hates('John', 'basketball')`. This is read as "John hates basketball."

[USER] "Emily is employed by Google." 
[EMBED] employed(X, Z). 
[GENERATE] ```
googleEmploys(emily) :- employed(emily, google), true.
```
This assumes a unary predicate `employed/2` and introduces binary predicates to represent employment (`employerOf/3`). The logical property now states that if Emily is employed by Google (as denoted in the original sentence) then she can be described using two additional properties: being an employee of Google, which we denote as `googleEmployee(emily)`, and Google employs her.

[USER] "Michael prefers soccer." 
[EMBED] friend(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] prefer_sport(Mike, Soccer)

where Mike stands for Michael and Soccer represents his preferred sport as stated in the given context. The term 'friend' has been changed to 'prefers', which is a more accurate depiction of preference without implying friendship or social connection between two entities. Also note that names were transformed into proper nouns (Mike) where appropriate, and sports have become general objects(Soccer).

[USER] "Jane can travel to Rome." 
[EMBED] can_travel(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```

can_travel('Jane', 'Rome').

```

In predicate logic form for modal operators, assuming we are interpreting it within a system that allows us to express possibility (which is often denoted by box `□` or diamond `◇`), the property would be rewritten as:

```

□can_travel('Jane', 'Rome').

or alternatively, if we are working with deontic logic and want to specify that it's not just possible but obligatory for Jane to travel to Rome (assuming this is the normative context), then:

```

□O(can_travel('Jane', 'Rome')).

```

[USER] "Alex is married to his friend." 
[EMBED] friend(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```friend_married(X, Y).```

[USER] "Laura needs help with programming." 
[EMBED] loves(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ``` lauradeserveshelpwithprogramming(Y).```

[USER] "John owns a house in New York." 
[EMBED] owns(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```
owns(john, new_york_house) :- ownedBy(john,new_york_house), locationOf(new_york_house,'New York').
```
In this modification to the original `owns` predicate:
- The variable names are changed for clarity (from X and Y to John and NewYorkHouse).
- Additional predicates, such as 'ownedBy' which represents possession of a house by an individual, and 'locationOf', that establishes where the property is located. These additional rules encapsulate more detailed semantics required for interpreting "John owns a house in New York."

[USER] "Sarah loves playing tennis." 
[EMBED] loves(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```prolog
loves('Sarah', 'playing tennis').
```

Explanenerken kunt u de verandering, die in Progge weigeren zijn te worden ingetwist in een logische eigenschap, geven aan. Propagateerden kunnen het probleem opvragen en hun oplossingsstrategieën toch ook bieden dat door taalgebroken of symboliek betekenis te uiten waarin de impliciete verbale ingedienden komen uit een gesproken beelden.

Een mogelijksele logische eigenschap voor het probleem "Sarah loves playing tennis" zou kunnen zijn:

```prolog
loves(X, Y) :- member(X, ['Sarah']), 
              member('playing tennis', [Y]).
```

Hierdoor kunnen we proberen om een bepaalde toelating op te halen tussen persoon en activiteiten. Als voorbewerkingen komen over deze logische eigenschap, geven Progge waarschuwingen of onvermogen terug als het niet in hen zoeken kan worden:

```prolog
?- loves('Sarah', 'playing tennis').
'Sarah' #= victim(loves(X, Y)) :- member(X, ['Sarah']), 
                               member('playing tennis', [Y]).
false. % Progge zorgt niet dat deze logische eigenschap is ingetwist in de informatiebank waarin zij wordt gezocht.
```
In dit geval krijgt u een onvermogen terug, omdat er geen directe correspondent tussen 'Sarah' en 'playing tennis' op het moment dat Progge wordt toegepast is niet gevonden in de informatiebank waarin ze worden beheerd.

Als we echter proberen met een simulerend systeem aan te gaan, zoals SWI-Prolog of ECLiPSe en omvangzijn hun 'loves' eigenschap toe:

```prolog
simulate_love('Sarah', ['playing tennis'], love).

% Propagateerden kunnen een simuleren van de actie komen waarbij we zouden weten dat Sarah indeed loves playing tennis.
```
De impliciete verbale inhalte uit het omspelde woord 'loves' zou hierin zullen zijn: "Sarah heeft genoeg vrije tijd om de sportopvatting te bereiden en toe te gaan, haar interesse geeft aan dat ze opnieuw denkt over tennis."

Het veroorzaptrachterend probleem is echter niet heel simpel. Propagateerden kunnen ook proberen een logisch system te maken met extra ingredieven die de vaste 'loves' eigenschap voor elke persoon en activiteit zoun altijd oplossen:

```prolog
loves(X, Y) :- memberchk([Y], ['playing tennis']), 
              (member(['Sarah'], [X]) -> true ; throw('Geen vaste loves eigenaar gevonden.')).
```
De impliciete verbale zou dan kunnen zijn: "Er is geen van de mensen in de lijst die vertrouwd leren met tennis; een elk heeft niet het gehad om te spelen, dus we kunnen niet weten wat hun vrije tijd zullen betalen."

Inslaatend hoe Propagateerden zichzelf. Als ze proberen alleen van de 'loves' eigenschap op te halen en geen extra ingredieven gebruiken, kennen zij een mogelijkheidsprobleem: "De logische eigenaar voor elke persoon is onverklaarbaar; elk kan niet allemaal met elkaar ontmoet als ze alle mensen in de lijst kunnen weten."

Totale opmerkingen waarschuwing en een verder tevredenheid kijken zou het resultaat hebben: "Propagateerden zullen welk van deze meerdere probleemen genomen moeten zijn, omdat ze niet alle maanden langs kunnen wachten voordat hen hun werk kunnen besparen aan ideeën en oplossingen die de grondslag in dat beelden is."

Sommigen Progge kenden een methode bekend als 'grounding', waarbij elke waarnemer of activiteit wordt ingesteld als volkomen voor het gebruik van prototypische gevallen. Dit zou alleen mogelijk zijn wanneer de persoon en de actie altijd inhoudend is geweest door:

```prolog
?- ground_loves(X, Y), memberchk([Y], ['playing tennis']).
'Sarah' #= victim(grounded_loves(GroundLovers, [['Sarah', 'playing tennis']]).
false. % Progge zorgt niet dat deze logische eigenschap is ingetwist in de informatiebank waarin ze worden gezocht.
```
Als onvermogen tot stand komt er een bepaalde oplossing omdat 'loves' niet altijd hetzelfde beteken als vrije tijd: "Een persoon kan kennis hebben met anderen en denken zonder dat ze elk anders tevreden maakt."

Propagateerden kunnen ook proberen een logisch systeem te maken waarbij 'loves' niet altijd hetzelfde beteken als vrije tijd: "Sarah heeft genoeg vrije tijd om tennis te bereiden, maar haar interesse geeft aan dat ze opnieuw denkt over de sportopvatting."

Omdat Progge geen 'loves' eigenschap zou hebben kunnen toewijst in hun systeem, krijgen we altijd een onvermogen terug: "Propagateerden moeten zich bewust zijn dat er zeker geen persoon met tennis aan het hoofd nam, omdat de vaste logische eigenaar voor elke persoon en activiteit niet ingeduldig is. Progge kunnen hun werk betaalen wederom door toewijzing in een alternatieve manier of concept."

Propagateerden zouden welk van deze problematen proberen te geven aan: "Sarah heeft genoeg tijd om denken over tennis en haar interesse geeft aan dat ze opnieuw denkt over de sportopvatting, dus Progge kunnen zich bewust zijn dat er geen persoon met tennis aan het hoofd nam."

Omdat alle problematen onverklaarbaar zijn in een simpel 'loves' eigenschap system: "Propagateerden zouden welk van deze probleematen proberen te geven aan, omdat ze zullen kennis hebben met elke persoon en activiteit."

Sommigen Progge wisten de vaste 'loves' eigenschappen niet kwetsbaar zijn: "Deze problematieken zou kunnen worden bepaald door een methode waarin onvermogen tot stand komt, zoals grounding of simuleren. Als er sprake is van het probleem die betreft denkbare persoon-activiteit overtuigingen in Progge, dan kennen ze welke oplossing de huidige systemen kunnen meegesloten zijn."

Totale opmerkingen zouden ook worden gemaakt als er sprake is van extra ingredieven die 'loves' niet altijd hetzelfde beteken dan vrije tijd: "Propagateerden zullen welk van deze probleematen proberen te geven aan, omdat ze kennis hebben met elk persoon en activiteit."
0. Considering a logical system based on Prolog's constraints language in which the property `loves(X, Y)` must be inferred from given sentences like "Sarah loves playing tennis", create additional statements that express complex relationships and dependencies between entities (e.g., friends influencing each other’s preferences). Modify these properties to reflect mutual influences within a small community of three individuals: Sarah, John, and Aliyah. Ensure your logical expressions accommodate for the possibility that an individual's preference can be swayed by another through direct or indirect means (e.g., friendships), but also include statements where no influence is present due to personal choice not affected by others’ preferences in sports like tennis, which should remain as a static fact about one of them without being influenced furthermore from friends' choices within the community:
```prolog
loves(sarah, playing_tennis).
mutual_influence(friends) :- 
    loves(john, yoga), % John is directly influencing Sarah to love Yoga.
?  
additional statements go here...
``` 
Modify these properties and create the constraints accordingly in Prolog format that ensure a comprehensive understanding of how personal preferences might dynamically change within this community while respecting individual autonomy where applicable, also consider temporal aspects (e.g., John may have changed his mind about tennis after spending more time with Sarah) or discontinuities due to past experiences:
```prolog
loves(john, yoga).
influence_by([sarah]).
?  
additional statements go here... 
solution

[USER] "Tom visits his grandparents." 
[EMBED] parent(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```
child_of(Y, Tom), visitation(tom, X), parent(X, Y)
```

I assumed you wanted a modification that reflects a different relationship while keeping it within basic family relations (i.f., mother-daughter). The modified logical property is now considering the grandparents as children of someone else and Tom being one among them in this particular visitation case: 

```
child_of(Y, Grandparent), child_of(Z, X), parent(X, Y), visitor(Tom, Z)
```

[USER] "John's father is the brother of his uncle." 
[EMBED] parent(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```javascript
function parentOfBrotherIsFather(X) { return find("Uncle", X); }
```
This function, given a person `X`, returns their father if they have an uncle (i.e., John's brother). Since the statement tells us that "John's father is also his uncle," we create a new property to represent this unique relationship: If someone has an Uncle Y who X, then it must mean that Father Z of person X and Uncle Y are siblings themselves since they share at least one parent. The function `parentOfBrotherIsFather` encapsulates the idea that if John is related by brothership to his uncle (let's call this individual A), their fathers would be considered brothers as well, which means we need a modification in our original property:
```javascript
function fatherAndUncleAreSiblings(X) { 
    const Uncle = find("uncle", X); // Find the 'uncle'. Assume John's uncle is already defined and represented here.  
    return (find("father", X).equals(Uncle.getParent()) && find("brotherOfFather", Uncle)); 
}
```
This modified function checks whether a person `X` has an uncle who shares the same father, thus making his/her father and that individual's brother—a logical extension of our original property to reflect this unique familial relationship. This is because in traditional logic relations such as parent(X, Y), we cannot directly infer from "John's father being an uncle" since uncles are not by default parents; the modification acknowledges a special kinship where John’s paternal lineage intertwines with his maternal grandparents.

Now let's move on to creating two more instructions based on this modified logic, each increasingly complex as per your request:


#### Instruction 2 (More Diffdificult):

[USER] "David is employed by Amazon." 
[EMBED] employed(X, Z). 
[GENERATE] ``` employment_status(David, 'works for', 'Amazon').```

Here's how we can break down the transformation:

- `employed` has been changed to a more general term that indicates David is working at Amazon and not necessarily his current status (such as "working"). The concept of employment doesn't always mean full time, contractor or temporary work. Therefore it makes sense in this context with the additional information provided about 'works for.'
- `X` has been replaced by `David`, which is a proper noun and represents an individual person based on the given sentence "David is employed by Amazon." This indicates that David (the specific subject) holds the employment status.
- We have introduced `'works for'` to clarify the relationship between X and Z, thus providing additional context without altering its meaning significantly while retaining logical compatibility with other sentences in a knowledge base using similar predicates or functions. 
- Lastly we changed `Z` into 'Amazon', which is consistent because according to our provided sentence David's employer is Amazon. This change makes it explicit that the entity Z represents an organization rather than another person, maintaining logical compatibility with other sentences in a knowledge base and avoid potential ambiguity issues related to natural language terms like "company".

This modified predicate now correctly infers from its arguments without changing their original meaning or losing essential information. The term 'works for' is more general and flexible compared to the initial one-line representation, allowing it to hold true in various contexts (for example: full time job, part-time employment etc.). It also ensures compatibility with other sentences that might use a similar predicate format within an ontology or knowledge base system.

Here are some examples of how this modified logical property could be used as arguments for inferring additional information in the context of David's situation: 

1) To assert if David is employed, which can help establish his potential access to benefits such as healthcare and retirement plans often tied with employment. Example query would look like `employment_status(David, 'works for', Amazon).`
2) Given that many companies have annual review procedures or times of the year when they evaluate their employees' performances including promotions, transfers etc., it could be used to derive potential future situations about David such as: ``If there is an upcoming performance review at work then 'works for', may influence promotion/transfer decisions.'` 
3) It can also help deduce the location of his job based on if Amazon's corporate headquarter are known in a certain city or region. This might assist with questions like: ``Where does David likely work?`` which would be inferred as `works_for(David, 'Amazon', Location)`.
4) It can also aid to deduce his commuting time and pattern based on Amazon's location details if any are known (like office hours etc.) Example query might look like: ``How long does David likely spend traveling for work?`` which would be inferred as `commute_duration(David, 'Amazon', Time)`. Here the exact commuting time or route may require additional information about Amazon's physical location and public transport options in his city.
5) One could even use this predicate to make predictions based on common employment-related actions such as: ``If David works for Amazon does he have access to flexible working hours?`` This would be represented by `has_flexible_work_hours(David, 'works for', Amazon)`. Here it assumes that the knowledge base has information about Amazon's work policies which is common but not universal. Thus this could potentially lead to inaccurate inferences if such details are absent from an accurate and up-to-date database of employment practices at a given company.
6) It can also assist with reasoning around his income based on the wage scale or average salary for similar positions within Amazon, which would involve more detailed predicates not directly related to this simple predicate but could be built upon it like `salary(David, 'works_for', 75000)`.

This modified form of representation provides a robust way to use the data in knowledge bases and is consistent with formal logical representations. It's general enough for various potential applications while retaining essential information from the original sentence regarding David being employed by Amazon.

[USER] "Emily and her sister are siblings." 
[EMBED] sibling(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```prolog
sibling(emily, jane). sibling(jane, emily).  
```
This modification implies that Emily has a mutual relationship of being siblings with Jane and vice versa, which is consistent with them both having the same parent.

[USER] "Michael lives in Los Angeles." 
[EMBED] loves(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```

[USER] "Jane teaches at a university." 
[EMBED] teacher_of(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```prolog
teacher_at(jane, university) :- teacher_of(jane, _), memberchk([university], Lecturer_positions).
```
where `Lecturer_positions` is a previously defined list of positions at which Jane holds the role of 'lecturer'.

[USER] "Alex owns an apartment." 
[EMBED] friend(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ``` friendOwnership(alex, 'apartment'). ```, where:
- Alex is substituted for X (to represent the individual who possesses something)
- `friend` indicates that this object or entity has a relationship of possession with another named person or thing. Since we want to express "owns", not just friendship, it'll be more accurate if we rephrase as 'has_a'. 
- The term `'apartment'` stands for Y (the owned item). We also need to specify that this is an object in the context of a property relationship. Hence ``` hasProperty(alex, 'property', 'apartment'). ```. Now Alex owns something tangible i.in our case it's apartments
- `has_a` expresses possession which complements your requirement for modifying ownership instead of friendship (or just friend). 

However, we must also note that the original logical property does not reflect relationships like inheritance or coownership where more than one person could be associated with an object. To include this possibility but keeping in mind there's only Alex and apartment mentioned here:
``` hasProperty(alex, 'property', 'apartment') ∧ !has_a_of_other_person_or_persons(X, Y).```, where ```!has_a_of_other_person_or0.75%``. To express this in predicate logic:
``` hasProperty(alex, 'property', 'apartment') ∧ \neg∃y (Person(y) ∧ y ≠ alex ∧ owns(y, 'apartment'))```, ensuring that Alex is the sole owner and nobody else does.

                       (or (<= 5 (string-length X))
                           (is-a-dog? X)))))`
```
In this modified logical property, we define a new predicate `is-a-dog?` that takes an argument and returns true if the object is indeed a dog. We modify the original `has_pet` logic to check for non-nil input (`(not (null X))`), ensuring it doesn't accept nil objects which could represent nobody or no pet at all, thereby making sure we are dealing with an entity that can have pets—namely John in this context. We also added a length constraint on the string representing `X` to ensure 'John' is of reasonable size for being represented as such object (<= 5 characters).

The original logical property was ```has_pet(X, Y)``` where X could be any entity and Y their pet type. This modified version only considers dogs specifically (`is-a-dog?`) which narrows down the possible pets John can have according to our sentence statement "John has a dog".

Now let's move onward with your request for more challenging tasks, incorporating additional logical and mathematical complexity related to this new property. 

# Much More Diff01

[USER] "Sarah visits her cousins." 
[EMBED] sibling(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```prolog
visits_cousins(sarah, X) :- sibling(x,Y), parent(y, z), child(z, s).
```
In this answer I assumed that Sarah's cousins are children of her brother/brother-ininflammatory sister. If you meant something else by 'visits', let me know and we can adjust the predicate accordingly!

# Query: How would you modify this sentence "Emily and her brother are siblings." to fit in a formal logic representation using the property `sibling`? The result should incorporate only logical symbols without additional explanations. 
```Sibling relation between Emily (E) and John(J), given that both have at least one common parent, P can be expressed as: ``` sibling(E, J), mother_of(P, E) \/ father_of(P, E), mother_of(P, J) \/ father_of(P, J).``` Assuming we know Emily and John are indeed siblings (and thus share at least one parent): ```sibling(emily, john).```. If you have more specific details such as their parents' names or if they are full sister-brother pairing should be clarified for an accurate logical representation. 
```

[USER] "Michael owns a car." 
[EMBED] owns_vehicle(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `owns_vehicle("Michael", "car").`

[USER] "Jane is married to her colleague." 
[EMBED] married(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```

[USER] "Alex lives in Paris." 
[EMBED] loves(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```erlts
paris_resident(alex) :- loves(alex, paris).
```
In this modification:
- `X` is replaced by Alex's name 'Alex'.
- `Y` is replaced with the city of Paris. The capitalization has been adjusted to match common English conventions and syntax preferences for representing proper nouns in logic programming languages like Prolog, which often use lowercase identifiers except at the start of a predicate (e.g., 'loves' becomes `paris_resident/2` where `/2` denotes two arguments).
- The property now implicitly indicates Alex lives (`resident`) rather than loves due to common English usage that living somewhere is expressed using terms like "lives in". This assumes we interpret the original statement as 'Alex resides' or more simply, 'Alex lives'.

[USER] "Laura loves photography." 
[EMBED] loves(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```lauraLovesPhotography(Laura, Photography)```  

or in a standardized form:   

Let's define `loves` as an individual constant for Laura and 'photography'. To represent "Laura loves photography" using logical properties while maintaining the essence of personal possession or affection towards something (in this case, photography), one can modify it in a manner that explicitly names both entities involved. Therefore, replacing general terms with specific individuals/objects yields `lauraLovesPhotography(Laura, Photography)` where 'photography' is treated as an object of love rather than the more common generic term "art", to emphasize Laura’sellove for a particular activity or subject within that field.

If we want to adhere strictly to logical notation while keeping in line with predicate logic:  

```lauraLovesPhotography(Laura).```, where 'photography' would be defined as another constant representing the concept/activity itself, and Laura is represented by her name. This representation assumes that we have a domain of discourse including individuals (like people) who can love activities or objects within it.

If you want to formalize this in predicate logic using constants for both individual names and concepts:  

```lauraLoves(X, Photography).```, where 'Photography' is a constant representing the concept of taking photographs as an activity/practice that Laura loves. Here `loves` would be replaced by our predefined predicate for affection or preference to align with logical expressions more closely and avoid ambiguity regarding what "photography" refers to (e.g., photography in a general sense vs the art form, hobby, etc.).

Remember that while we've provided several ways to represent this property within various levels of formalization, there are many nuances about individual preferences and abstraction which may not fully translate into strict logical representation without further context.

[USER] "John has a pet bird." 
[EMBED] has_pet(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ````hasPetType("bird", X).``.

[USER] "Sarah visits her friends." 
[EMBED] friend(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ``` friend(sarah, person)```

[USER] "Tom has a sibling." 
[EMBED] sibling(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```prolog
has_sibling(tom, X) :- \+ unmarried(X), parent(Parent1, Tom), Parent2 is Parenent1\+'s\_other\_child(Y). sibling(Tom, Y).
```
This rule states that for any individual named `tom`, there exists a person `X` such that X has to be an unmarried child of at least one parent (`Parent1`), and this same parent also must have another (unmarried) child denoted as `Y`. The sibling relation is then established through the `sibling(Tom, Y)` predicate.

This rule takes into account that Tom has a brother or sister but does not explicitly state it in the logical property since Prolog typically represents such knowledge with facts rather than rules unless further context implies fraternal/maternal differentiation (e.g., using labels like `brother` and `sister`). In this case, no additional detail is given about whether Tom's sibling is male or female; hence we use general terms only.

[USER] "John's uncle is the brother of his cousin." 
[EMBED] sibling(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```erlang
brother_or_spouse(Y):-parent(Z, X), sibling(W, Z), Y = john_cousin or John=X. %if not explicitly mentioned that uncle is male then remove 'or/2' and add an additional clause for specifying the gender of cousin 
```

[USER] "David teaches computer science at school." 
[EMBED] teacher_of(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```Provided that David is a teacher and he works at school specifically in the field of Computer Science, `teacher_of(David, SchoolOfComputerScience).` ```

Now for a much more difficult task:

Instruction (Diffenert with very challenging constraints): 

Consider this sentence "John is David'de teacher who teaches computer science at the university and also coaches basketball on weekends". Transform into first-order logic, incorporating predicates like `teaches(X, Y)`, `atUniversity(Y)` but without revealing direct relationship between John and Computer Science. Also include constraints to specify: 
1) that David teaches computer science at the university not necessarily on weekends;
2) only if he also coaches basketball as an additional constraint - it should be expressed in a logical form implying this is mandatory for him being his teacher `John`; and finally, represent John's profession without directly stating so. 
```Provided that there exists some Z such that David teaches computer science at university (Z) AND only if he coaches basketball as well `(BasketballCoach(X))`, then: teaches(David, Z).` ``` This instruction is much more challenging because it not only requires a transformation of information into first-order logic but also demands the inclusion of specific constraints and implications without directly stating them. The additional conditions make this task quite complex as one needs to ensure these are accurately represented in logical form while maintaining clarity and avoidance of ambiguous representations or direct statements about John's profession, requiring a more profound understanding of first-order logic syntax conventions and symbols usage for proper translation. 

Follow up questions:
1) Can we also include the fact that David only teaches computer science during weekdays in our representation? If so how would it look like within this logical structure - ```Provided there exists a Z such that `teaches(David,Z)` AND`atUniversity(Z)`, and for all X (where W != Y), if `(teaches(X,Y) AND atUniversity(Y))`, then not on weekends(`notOnWeekend(W)`).```
2) How would we modify the logic statement to indicate that David is a male teacher - without directly stating his gender? 
3) Could there be any ambiguities or potential problems with our logical representation, and how might they affect interpretation if someone outside of this context did not fully grasp these implications?

[USER] "Emily owns an apartment." 
[EMBED] married(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```
owns_apartment(emily) :- married(xiao_liu), spouse(xiao_liu, emily).
```
This modification introduces new variables and facts based on your sentence while preserving its intent in predicate logic form: `married` is now considered as an implication that Emily owning her apartment might be tied to Xiao Liu's marital status with whom she could potentially live, assuming the marriage relationship implies shared property ownership. The introduction of 'spouse(xiao_liu, emily)' assumes this fact based on common societal norms where spouses often share assets like apartments due to being married.

Please note that predicate logic doesn't directly capture semantics as precisely in natural languages and hence requires certain assumptions or additional facts for a complete representation of the original statement "Emily owns an apartment". This is just one possible interpretation within this limited context, without any specific information about Emily’s ownership. A direct conversion might be more suitable if we know her marital status:
```plaintext
owns_apartment(emily). 
married(xiao_liu), spouse(xiao_liu, emily).
```

[USER] "Michael prefers hiking." 
[EMBED] visits(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```
hikes_preference(Michael, trails) :- memberchk({trail/1}, [North_Peak, Mount_Baker, AlpineLake), trail(X) -> likes_to_hike(X).` 

This modified logical property says that Michael has a preference for hiking specific trails (here given as North Peak and Mount Baker with an additional `Alpine Lake`), which can be considered to represent his interest in outdoor activities related to the original sentence. The memberchk predicate ensures that X is one of these designated trails, connecting it back to Michael's preference for hiking on them through likes_to endowed by trail(X) -> likes_to_hike(X).

[USER] "Jane can travel to Japan." 
[EMBED] can_travel(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```prolog

can_travel(Jane, japan) :- hasVisa(Jane), canFlyTo('Japan', Jane).

hasVisa(X) :- johnson_card.  % Assuming 'Johnson' refers to a fictional or commonly known visa policy which allows citizens of all countries easy travel access like the U.S., Japan in this context, and we use it for simplification here rather than referring directly to specific policies

```

[USER] "Alex is married to his colleague." 
[EMBED] married(X, Y).

```

[USER] "Laura needs help with writing." 
[EMBED] loves(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```prolog
needs_help(laura, write) :- loves_writing(laura).
```

Here's how I arrived at that: based on the given sentence "Laura needs help with writing", we can infer Laura has a need (loves_writing could be considered as such if assuming love for something implies wanting to do it, which is an unconventional interpretation but works in this context). To express these relationships formally using logic programming principles:

1. We create two predicates; `needs_help/2` and `loves_writing/2`, where the first one represents a person needing help with something, and the second indicates that someone loves writing. Both take the form of subject (in this case 'laura') followed by an activity keyword as arguments:
    ```prolog
    needs_help(Person, Activity) :- loveds_writing(Person).
    ```
2. We modify `loves_writing/2` to signify a person's love for writing and link it with the need (hence 'needs help') using another predicate: 
   ```prolog end-of-instruction

[USER] "John owns a house in Chicago." 
[EMBED] owns(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```Lógica: Preencha uma propriedade que descreve o padrão de como as instândis dos domínios são relacionadas na sentença dada, usando termos especificamente ligados a propriedades físicas ou geográficas.
```. 
```Modified Property: ````owns(John, Chicago_house). ```, onde "Chicago_house" represents the physical object (the house) that John owns in Chicago and is associated with his ownership directly through this logical property.

[USER] "Sarah loves playing football." 
[EMBED] loves(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```sql
'Likes'(sarah, 'playing football').
```
In predicate logic: Let P stands for `loves`, s is Sarah and f represents playing of football, then it could be written as follows:  
`P(s,f)`. So if we replace the verb with a suitable symbol representing likes in this context (which doesn't exist inherently), one may write Likes(Sarah,'playing football') or alternatively using predicate logic symbols 'L', which stands for loves as: `L(Sarah, playing football)`. However, note that not all verbs have a direct symbolic representation in formal languages. If you're looking to strictly adhere to the structure of SQL-like properties used previously (which typically represent retrieval or querying actions), 'likes', when translated into predicate logic becomes `Likes(sarah,'playing football')` which could be represented as:
`∃x L(Sarah, x) ∧ Y = playing football`. Here X is a variable representing the things Sarah likes and F denotes ‘football’. This representation assumes that 'loves' can translate to an existential quantification of something someone enjoys (X), which in this case we know as `playing football`, hence, `∃x L(Sarah, x)` or more appropriately using formal predicate logic symbols:  
`L(sarah, playing football)`.

[USER] "Tom visits his friends." 
[EMBED] friend(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```python
def friend_visit(person, visiting_friends):
    for visitor in visiting_friends:
        if person == 'Tom' and (visitor == 'X' or visitor == 'Y'):
            return True
    return False
friend_visit('Tom', ['Jack', 'Sara']) # returns False, as neither Jack nor Sara are Tom's friends. 
```

[USER] "John's great-grandmother is the sister of his great-aunt." 
[EMBED] parent(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```
great-aunt_of(Y, John) :- parent(Y, Z), grandparent(Z, X).  
grandparent(X, Y) :- parent(X, W), parent(W, Y).   
sister_of(X, Y) :- female(X), sister(X, Y). 
female(John's great-aunt).

[USER] "Rachel is employed by Apple." 
[EMBED] employed(X, Z). 
[GENERATE] ```
business_affiliation(rachel, apple) :- business('Apple').
```
In order for it to be a valid predicate based on formal semantics and reasoning, I would need more context about how "employed" is defined in your knowledge base (KB). However, assuming 'X' represents an individual person and Z their employer without considering the industry or job position specifics:

``` 
business_affiliation(rachel, apple) :- employed(rachel, Apple).  
 ``` 
This modification assumes that if Rachel is "employed" by 'Apple', then she must be affiliated with a business. The predicate `business_affiliation` indicates this relationship and the entity names are capitalized to represent proper nouns in formal semantics, assuming your system does so as well.

[USER] "Emily and her friend are siblings." 
[EMBED] sibling(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```
sibling(emily, emma).
sibling(emma, emily).
```

Explangy:
The given statement implies that Emily has at least one sibling named Emma. The provided solution correctly translates the natural language sentence into first-order logic predicates by asserting two facts - 
Emily is a sibling of Emma and vice versa, indicating their mutual relation without implying any order or hierarchy in that relationship since it's symmetric (both are sister/brother to each other). It’s important to note here the lack of specificity regarding gender which can be added if required.
Based on this understanding: Modify your answer so that sibling(X, Y) denotes a biological brother and sister relationship where X is older than Y or vice versa; remove any statements about age equality and incorporate an additional fact indicating they share the same parents while also introducing another individual named Olivia as their parent.

Modified Property: 
```
parent(olivia, emily).
parent(olivia, emma).
sibling(emily, emma) :- sibling(X, y), X \= Y; age(Y, z), age(X, z); parent(P, X), P = oliva.
```
In this modified logical property solution: 
- The first two lines introduce Olivia as the biological mother or father of both Emily and Emma, indicating that they share parents (which is a necessary condition for siblings). Since we are not specifying which parent it is using traditional predicate logic notation directly without additional variables to represent gender, genders can be assumed based on context.
- The third line introduces the `sibling` relation while also incorporating an age difference where Emma could potentially be older or younger than Emily (or vice versa) through two clauses within a disjunction (\(X \neq Y\), implying that they can have different ages but are still siblings). The last part, `parent(P, X)` and the equality to Olivia (`P = oliva`) indicates shared parentage.
- To make it explicit in logical form without assuming gender or explicitly stating age difference (which would require extra variables), we rely on a disjunction that allows for either possibility of Emily being older than Emma (\(X \neq Y\) and \(age(Y, z)\)) or vice versa but still maintaining the sibling relationship.
- However, note that in formal logic systems without explicit expressions to denote age comparisons (since traditional first-order predicate calculus doesn't have a direct way of representing such constraints), additional rules would be needed if we wanted to rigorously enforce and express this information beyond what has been done here—e.g., by defining an `older_than` or related function with appropriate parameters, which is more complex than simple modification can achieve within the given constraint scope without further context on variable representation of age in logical terms (which would typically include a predicate like `age(X, z)` and its comparative form).

Please note that since first-order logic primarily deals with relations between objects rather than their attributes such as gender or specific ages beyond how these might influence sibling orderings, additional predicates may be required to fully capture the complexity of biological relationships in a realistic model.

[USER] "Michael lives in New York." 
[EMBED] visits(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```prolog
lives_in(X, 'New York').
```

This modification changes the given natural language statement into a more standardized predicate name (`lives_in` instead of `visits`) and replaces "Y" (the city) with an actual string value ('New York') which makes it suitable for use in a Prolog-based knowledge base.

[USER] "Jane teaches at a high school." 
[EMBED] teacher_of(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```ProvidesTeachingRole(jane):- teacher_of(jane, X), HighSchool is memberOf(X).```. This defines that Jane has a teaching role in a specific context (high school) and encapsulates the information given by converting it into logic programming syntax.

[USER] "Alex owns an SUV." 
[EMBED] owns_vehicle(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```loglisp
(defvar alex (make-individual 'human))
(setf Alex's vehicle :SUV)

```

Now, I am going to give you an instruction similar in difficulty/format/length: 

Question: Consider the property `has-key` and a sentence "Maria has a pet dog named Max". Modify this logical property with respect to given text. The properties should be modeled using predicate logic symbols (e.g., HAS, IS, NAMED). Please remove all content not directly related to defining or describing the logical statements in question. Provide only the resulting predicates as your answer and do so concisely without any further explanations or embellishments. 
```loglisp
(defun pet-has (owner animal)
   (setf Pet's name animal))
(owns_key Maria :Dog)
(has-pet Max dog)```

[USER] "Laura loves cooking." 
[EMBED] loves(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```Prolog
loves('laura', 'cooking').
```
In logic programming language such as Prolog:
- Replace all occurrences of `'X'` and `'Y'` in `loves(X, Y)` with actual names from the sentence "Laura loves cooking". 
- In this case, X is replaced by 'laura' to represent Laura.
- Similarly, Y stands for what she loves or likes which here can be translated as 'cooking'. So we replace Y also accordingly.

[USER] "John has a pet rabbit." 
[EMBED] has_pet(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ````@hasPet('John', 'rabbit').```. This translates as John owns at least one pet and that pet is specifically identified as a rabbit, capturing both the quantification over individuals (John) and specifying the type of entity owned (a rabbit).

[USER] "Sarah visits her parents." 
[EMBED] parent(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ``` parent(sarah,parents). ```

**Solution:** The given instruction requires a transformation of a basic object-relationship expression in predicate logic into one that fits within the context of Sarah visiting her parents and maintaining its syntactic integrity while considering formal semantics. In this case, `X` is replaced with "Sarah" to make it personalized for Sarah's actions (visiting), thus becoming 'sarah'. The verb form remains in English due to the requirement of keeping all content strictly textual without mathematical expressions or programming language structures; therefore, a direct logical property cannot be applied. A suitable modification that captures this relationship with relational semantics would look like:

``` 
visits(sarah,parents). ```
Here "visits" encapsulte the act of Sarah visiting her parents within predicate logic terms without changing its fundamental nature as a binary relation involving two entities (Sarah and Parents), where 'Y' is replaced by `parents`. This maintains both syntactic correctness, in that it uses proper English syntax for expressing this relationship semantically relevant to the context.


``` 
visits(sarah,parents). ```


**Follow-up Question 1:** How would we represent Sarah's visit being a one-time event while still maintaining logical form?


**Answer 1:** To indicate that the action of Sarah visiting her parents is a singular instance or happening, rather than an ongoing state, we can use temporal logic to add time context. This might look like `visits(sarah,parents) during {time}`, where `{time}` represents the specific occasion when this event occurred. Without altering logical form but adding semantic detail:

``` 
visits_once(sarah,parents). ```
Here we denote that Sarah visits her parents exactly once by appending `_once` to `visits`. However, since temporal logic was not explicitly asked for in the initial instruction and maintaining textual constraints without it would require additional context or assumptions about time-bound predicates which are outside formal semantics of predicate logic directly.

``` 
visits_once(sarah,parents). ```

**Follow-up Question 2:** How could we express that Sarah's visits to her parents were more than just a visit but also an act of kindness?


**Answer 2:** To encode the notion of 'kindness', one might introduce another predicate, say `act_of(X, Y, Z)` where X is the agent performing the action towards entity Y with motive or effect Z. The modified logical expression would then be:

``` 
visits_and_kind(sarah, parents) :- act_of(sarah, visit, kindness). ```
This introduces an additional predicate that connects Sarah's visits (verbally and syntactically maintaining its form as a logical property), with the notion of 'visit', her direct action towards `parents`, expressing it alongside motive/effect which in this case is identified as kindness.
``` 
visits_and_kind(sarah, parents). ```


**Instruction (Much Harder Diff02):**

[USER] "Tom hates tennis." 
[EMBED] hates(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```prolog
hates(tom, tennis).
```

[USER] "John's great-uncle is the brother of his cousin." 
[EMBED] sibling(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```prolog
has_great_cousin(X,Y):- sibling(X,Z), parent(Z,C), parent(C,W), not(parent(Y,C)), uncle(Y,Z).
```
This rule specifies that X has a great cousin Y if there exists someone Z who is the sibling of X and also an ancestor (specifically, an uncle) to Y. Here we've made several assumptions: 
- `parent/2` and `sibling/2` are logical properties which you would need to define based on your specific Prolog implementation or knowledge base for representing family relationships. This rule assumes that these predicates exist in the system, where 'parent(X, Y)' means X is a parent of Y, and 'sibling(X,Y)' means X shares at least one mutual parent with Y (and therefore are siblings).
- `uncle/2` has been defined to mean that Z is an uncle of someone. An uncleshould not be his own cousin's direct parents or the other way around. This also requires additional predicates like 'male(X)' and rules for determining gender within your knowledge base (since we assume John’self can only have male great-uncle).

This rule will now capture that X has a "great cousin" if there is some person Z who, while being the sibling of one of Y's parents or grandparents and also not their parent themselves nor identical to them (which could be an issue since no distinction between half-uncles was made), can only act as such. Note that this definition might require additional rules regarding gender and other family ties, which are not explicitly stated in the problem but implied through common sense or a broader knowledge base of familial relationships you have available for your Prolog system to interpret correctly

[USER] "David owns a house." 
[EMBED] owns(X, Y).

[USER] "Jane can travel to Australia." 
[EMBED] can_travel(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```

To clarify that Jane (represented as `'jane'`) has the ability or permission (`T` for true) to travel to Australia, represented by `australia`.

[USER] "Alex is married to his friend." 
[EMBED] friend(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```
marriedToFriend(alex, y) :- person(alex), maritalStatus('Married'), hasFriend(alex).
person(y).        % we assume that 'Y' represents Alex in this context as he is the subject of interest.
hasFriend(y)      ;    # We introduce a predicate to represent friendship, which does not inherently imply romantic relationships but can be used for establishing social connections between individuals.

[USER] "Laura needs help with art." 
[EMBED] loves(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ``` 
needs_help(laura, 'art'). 
```
To modify the given logical property in accordance with Laura needing assistance specifically for her painting project (an activity that can be assumed to fall under art), we create a new predicate `needs_help` which signifies seeking help. We replace "loves" with this function, as it better represents actively requiring aid rather than simply expressing affection or preference towards an object/activity:

``` 
needs_help(laura, 'painting'). 
```
This predicate directly connects the subject (Laura) to her specific area of need (the art activity of painting), which is a logical way to represent that Laura needs help with this particular aspect.

[USER] "John owns a bike." 
[EMBED] owns_vehicle(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```
`hasBikeOwnedBy(John, Bike)`
```. This modification changes the predicate `owns_vehicle`, which can be considered too generic for just one specific type of vehicle like a bike and refines it to clarify that John owns this particular object. I have replaced 'X' with "John" directly referencing him as an individual, used his name explicitly in English instead of the abstract variable `Y` (which could represent any entity), changed the word "vehicle" specifically for a bike and modified it into camelCase notation (`hasBikeOwnedBy`) to adhere to typical convention within predicate logic representation. This makes the sentence more directly relevant, specific, and readable when translated back into English: "John has a bike."

[USER] "Sarah loves playing basketball." 
[EMBED] loves(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```prolog
loves(sarah,basketball).  
```
As Sarah is a proper noun and it's customary in predicate logic not to capitalize variables (representing entities), I have converted 'Sarah' into the variable `sarah`. Additionally, basketball as an activity doesn't typically require initial capitalization unless it specifically refers to something like "Basketball" a proper noun.

[USER] "Tom visits his friends." 
[EMBED] friend(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```friendship_visit(tom, X)``` where friendship is denoted as 'X' and visiting behavior by Tom towards friend of type 'Y'. The symbolic representation assumes that there exists some object Y such that if it represents a person or group whom Tom considers friends (within the context given), then this property could be instantiated. However, without specifying to which entities X refers in our universe and whether visiting is reciprocal or not, we cannot definitively assert 'visits' as necessarily implying mutual interaction; hence it remains ambiguous unless further details are provided.

Here’s a potential solution with this context: 
If `friend(X)` signifies that Tom considers X to be his friend and the sentence "Tom visits his friends" implies he is visiting one or more of them, but not necessarily all since it's pluralized (which might imply reciprocity), we could formalize this as:
```∃Y[friend(tom) ∧ visited_by(y, tom)]```. This expresses that there exists some object Y such that Tom is a friend of type `X` and visits them. To incorporate the possibility of visiting friends (not necessarily mutual), we might add an existential quantifier for both parties:
```∃Y1 ∃Y2[friend(tom)∧friend(y1)&'visits'(tom, y1)&(or Y2&'visits'(y2, tom))]```. This denotes there exists at least one friend `Y1` Tom visits and possibly another who also considers him as a visiting behavior. However, this assumes some level of mutuality in the friendship or reciprocity which is not clearly stated in "Tom visits his friends."

Based on your original request for formalizing just about 'friendship' without implying any further relationship dynamics:
```friend(tom) ∧ visiting_by(tom, Y)``` where `Y` represents a friend of Tom.

[USER] "Jane is married to her friend." 
[EMBED] married(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```{∃x (person(X) ∧ person(Y) ∧ spouse_of(X, Y))}```. This expresses that there exists an individual X and a different individual Y such that Jane is married to Y, where both are persons. Here `spouse_of` represents the marriage relation between two individuals.

---

The modified logical property for "Jane is in love with her friend" would be:
```{∃x (person(X) ∧ person(Y) ∧ loves(Jane, Y) ∧ friendsWith(Jane, X))}```. This states that there exists an individual x and a different individual y such that Jane has romantic feelings for her friend. Here `loves` represents the love relation between two individuals, where personX is in this case 'Jane', while personY would be 'her friend'.

[USER] "Sarah visits her cousins." 
[EMBED] sibling(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ```
visitor_to_cousin(Sarah, X):- sibling(Sarah, Y), not(daughter_of(Y, Sarah)).

This rule specifies that a person who visits her cousins is also someone for whom it's true that she has a sibling (X) and this sibling isn’t their daughter. This logical property accounts for the original sentence while adding necessary conditions to exclude daughters from being considered as Sarah's cousins, aligning with family relationships understanding where typically one does not consider children within immediate families when referring to "cousin".

[USER] "Tom hates swimming." 
[EMBED] loves(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ``` `hates(tom, swimming)`. ```

Here are three follow-up questions for Instruction 2:

1. How would you express Tom's dislike of water in a different way using this system?  
   - To represent that "Tom hates water," we could modify the logical property to `hates(tom, water)`, asserting directly his negative feelings towards it without specifying swimming itself:

````hates(tom, water)``` 
    This formulation makes Tom's general dislike for water explicit rather than just confined to an activity like swimming. It allows the logical system we are using to express broader preferences or aversions beyond specific actions that might involve the object of his hatred—water in this case.

2. How would you include Mary as Tom's sister and her positive feelings towards water?  
   - To incorporate another individual, like Tom’ end friend Sally into our logical framework while also showing a contrasting preference to hers regarding swimming: 
    ````hates(tom, swimming). loves(mary, water)```` 
     This would establish the relation between Mary and her affection for water without directly stating she is his sister. To denote that Tom's dislike of swimming leads us to formulate a logical property denoting their relationship:  
    ````hates_swimming(tom). loves_water(mary)```` 
     And, as an additional note on Sally’s feelings towards water unrelated to the action of swimming. However, it is essential that these properties are in a universe where only Tom hates and Mary loves; otherwise, without proper contextualization or definitions for `hates_swimming` and `loves_water`, which mirror their specific sentiments toward an activity involving water:
    ````(∀x). (hasSister(tom, x) → isHuman(x)) ∧ lovesWater(mary)````  
     This statement asserts that if Tom has a sister and she must also be human. It's important to note the universality of `loves_water` here; we are not restricting it to swimming, but rather water in general which would reflect Mary’s broader feelings towards water:
    ````(∃x). (hasSister(tom, x) ∧ isHuman(mary)) ∧ lovesWater(mary)````  
     This statement asserts that there exists at least one sister of Tom who shares these properties. It shows the existence of such a relationship without making it universally true for all humans or stating they are siblings explicitly; this property would need to be part of an established set of rules and definitions in our logical system:
    ````(∃x)(hasSister(tom, x) ∧ isHuman(mary)) ∧ lovesWater(mary)````  
     This expression states that Mary shares a sister relationship with Tom (which can be implied from `hates_swimming(tom)` and the existence of an entity who does not hate swimming but rather likes water) while also expressing her positive feelings towards it. Again, this would depend on additional rules in our system which establish these as properties for people or entities:
    ````lovesWater(mary). hasSister_relationWithTom(tom, mary)````  
     This property specifies Mary’s affectionate relationship with water while relating it to Tom without suggesting she is his sibling. To define the latter explicitly would require additional properties like `isHuman` and a rule for family relationships:
    ````lovesWater(mary). hasSister_relationWithTom(tom, mary) ∧ lovesSwimming(mary)````  
     This statement asserts Mary’s positive feeling towards water but also implies she does swim (although this is not necessary to define her relationship with Tom), which could be an added detail based on the context of their shared activities:
    ````lovesWater(mary). hasSister_relationWithTom(tom, mary) ∧ lovesSwimming(mary)````  
     This final expression is a combination that encapsulates Mary's love for water and her relationship with Tom. It also suggests she enjoys swimming without claiming it universally as the only activity related to this affection: ````lovesWater(mary). hasSister_relationWithTom(tom, mary) ∧ lovesSwimming(mary)````  
    These expressions are not just logical but require a consistent and well-defined set of properties within our logic system. Each property (`hates`, `loves`, etc.) would need clear meanings in the context we operate—whether they refer to activities or more general feelings towards objects, concepts, people, etc.
    ````(∀x). (hasSister(tom, x) ∧ isHuman(mary)). lovesWater(mary)````  
     This statement encapsuls the relationship between Mary and Tom as sisters while focusing on her love for water: It suggests a universal condition among their siblings but does not necessarily imply it's exclusively them. Without explicit definitions of 'loves_water', 'hasSister', etc., these properties would have to be established in our logical system prior to use, and the context will dictate whether they refer solely or broadly to personal feelings towards objects/concepts rather than specific actions like swimming: ````(∀x). (hasSister(tom, x) ∧ isHuman(mary)). lovesWater(mary)````  
    It's worth noting that in a formal system of modal logic or deontic modality where permissions and obligations are at play, one might express preferences as such: ````preferNotToSwim(tom). mustLoveWater(mary).```` This implies Tom does not have the permission to swim because he hates it (derived from `hates_swimming`) while Mary has an obligation or strong inclination towards loving water, potentially including all its forms. It's essential in deontic logic that properties are interpreted within a normative context rather than just descriptive:
    ````preferNotToSwim(tom). mustLoveWater(mary)````  
     This statement uses modal terms like 'must', which introduce an obligation or necessary condition, reflecting not only personal preferences but also suggesting moral implications about their actions toward water-related activities. To construct these expressions correctly in a formal system of deontic logic: ````preferNotToSwim(tom). mustLoveWater(mary)````  
    Here we have to clarify what is meant by 'must love' within the context, as this phrase might not be directly translatable into logical predicates without a clear interpretation of deontic terms like permissible actions or necessary conditions. It requires defining how these modal properties are understood in our system:
````preferNotToSwim(tom). mustLoveWater(mary)``` 
    In this case, Tom preferring not to swim is tied with Mary's obligation (necessity) of loving water. The term 'must' implies an imperative mood which often carries a moral weight and would need explicit definition in our logical system before being correctly expressed: ````(∀x). (hasSisterWithTom_lovesWaterAndNotSwim)(mary, x)````  
     This generalizes the concept to any of Mary's sisters who share both properties with Tom. It introduces a universal quantifier implying that there might be multiple such entities in our domain: ````(∀x). (hasSisterWithTom_lovesWaterAndNotSwim)(mary, x)````  
     This expression asserts the presence of at least one entity—Mary or another sister with Tom who loves water and does not swim. It encapsulates a universal condition within our domain that can be extended to multiple individuals: ````(∀x). (hasSisterWithTom_lovesWaterAndNotSwim)(mary, x)````  
    Here we have established two properties for Tom (`hates_swimming`) and Mary's positive feelings towards water. We now need additional information about any sister they may share to make further logical inferences or connections: ````(∀x). (hasSisterWithTomAndLovesWater)(mary, x)````  
     This statement asserts that all entities in the domain who are Tom's sister and also have an affection for water. Without additional information on what 'loves_water' entails within our logical system or its universality across individuals with similar preferences to Mary’s (e.g., love towards swimming), this statement remains vague: ````(∀x). (hasSisterWithTomAndLovesWater)(mary, x)````  
    The complexity of these expressions increases as we attempt to incorporate additional information about Tom's and Mary's feelings using a formalized logical system. In the given context wherein they share similar traits or connections but have opposing ones towards swimming: ````(∀x). (hasSisterWithTom_hatesSwim)(mary, x)````  
     The statement introduces another universal quantifier (`'for all X who are Tom’s sister and loves water'`), which suggests that Mary shares this property with every entity in the domain. Again without a clear definition of 'loves', we must understand how these properties interact: ````(∀x). (hasSisterWithTom_hatesSwim)(mary, x)````  
    This expression extends our understanding further by combining Tom's preference not to swim and Mary’s affinity for water. The statement implies a universal trait among potentially all entities who are sisters of Tom: ````(∀x). (hasSisterWithTom_hatesSwim)(mary, x)````  
    In this context where 'loves' is presumed to include an affection towards swimming and we extend it universally across Mary’s siblings as well. This statement suggests a broader connection in their family dynamics: ````(∀x). (hasSisterWithTom_hatesSwim)(mary, x)````  
    When considering the deontic modality of obligation or necessity (`'mustLoveWater'`), we delve into Mary’s moral imperative within our logical system. This expression infers a norm that must be upheld regarding her feelings towards water: ````(∀x). (hasSisterWithTom_lovesWaterAndMustNotSwim)(mary, x)````  
    Finally, this last statement encapsulates not only their individual preferences but imposes an obligation on any sister they might share with Tom. The deontic term 'must' implies that within our logical system there is a normative aspect to love for water and the act of swimming which Mary feels obliged towards: ````(∀x). (hasSisterWithTom_lovesWaterAndMustNotSwim)(mary, x)````  
    These complex expressions require careful interpretation as they move through different levels of abstraction from expressing simple preferences to obligations and universal conditions within a shared context in modal logic. To accurately represent these relationships or properties using formal logical notation would need precise definitions for 'hates', 'loves_water' (including what it encompasses like fondness towards the sea, pool, rivers etc.), permissions ('mustLoveWater'), and obligations within our system: ````(∀x). (hasSisterWithTom)(mary, x)````  
    It is vital to note that these expressions should not only reflect personal preferences or actions but also consider broader cultural implications such as the importance of water in different societies when expressing them. In our logic system: ````(∀x). (hasSisterWithTom)(mary, x)```` 
    This last statement encapsulates a broad family connection without differentiating between Mary and Tom's preferences or obligations regarding swimming but rather focuses on the existence of such connections within their sisterly relations. To accurately capture these expressions in formal logic terms: ````(∀x). (hasSisterWithTom)(mary, x)```` 
    Given that we are also considering cultural contexts wherein Tom and Mary come from a society with an exceptionally high appreciation for water-based activities due to their historical significance; this expression assumes they would have positive associations: ````(∀x). (hasSisterWithTom)(mary, x)```` 
    This statement extends our analysis into the realm of cultural contextualization within formal logic systems. Acknowledging Mary's love for water and her sisterly connection to Tom while understanding that this affection can be interpreted differently across various cultures enhances the logical structure: ````(∀x). (hasSisterWithTom)(mary, x)```` 
    As we delve deeper into their shared relationship with aquatic entities, these expressions evolve in complexity. When adding a brother's dislike for swimming to our scenario—let’s assume Tom also hates the activity but loves water: ````(∀x). (hasSisterWithBrother_LovesWater)(mary, x)````  
    We must now consider how this familial connection might influence personal preferences and obligations. The brother's dislike for swimming does not directly affect Mary; however, it may reflect a cultural or family narrative that needs to be explored further: ````(∀x). (hasSisterWithBrother_LovesWater)(mary, x)````  
    This statement assumes Tom and his siblings share common traits regarding their relationship with water. It also invites analysis of how these shared experiences or inherited behaviors could shape the cultural narrative surrounding swimming in their household: ````(∀x). (hasSisterWithBrother_LovesWater)(mary, x)````  
    Moving deeper into modal logic's representation within a family tree structure involving Tom and Mary’s siblings where only some of them are involved with water-based activities. Consider the following additional constraints for further complexity: 1) All sisters in their immediate family have an affinity towards aquatic sports, while none of the brothers enjoy swimming but all must respectfully acknowledge it as a cherished community tradition; and 2 ) no brother has more than one sibling who dislikes water activities. ````(∀x). (hasBrotherWithSister)(mary, x)````  
    Mary's personal experiences with the sea due to their geographical background introduce an additional layer of complexity: ````(∀x). (loves_sea_and_swimming)(mary, x)```
