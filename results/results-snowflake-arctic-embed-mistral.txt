[USER] "John's sister is Sarah." 
[EMBED] sibling(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `sibling(X, 'Sarah') :- name('Sarah', _), parent_of(Z, X), sibling(Z, 'John').`

Here, we assume that individuals are represented as atoms starting with lowercase letters (e.g., 'John', 'Sarah'), and families are connected via `parent_of/2`. The modified property states that an individual X is a sibling of Sarah if there exists some common parent Z such that both X and John are siblings to Z.

[USER] "John is married to Emily." 
[EMBED] married(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `married(John, Emily).`

[GENERATE] `needs_help_with('math', 'Laura').

[USER] "John's mother is the sister of his aunt." 
[EMBED] owns(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] Based on the given sentence, we can infer a relationship between John's mother, aunt, and their common parent (siblings). However, it's important to note that the original property `owns(X, Y)` doesn't seem to be directly related to this statement.

To represent the relationships in the sentence using a logical property, we might use something like:

```prolog
parent(mother_of_john, john).
sister(aunt_of_john, mother_of_john).
```

This says that the mother of John is a person (we'll call her `mother_of_john`) and that the aunt of John is the sister (sibling) of his mother (`aunt_of_john` is the sister of `mother_of_john`).

[USER] "Tom visits his grandparents." 
[EMBED] hates(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `loves(X, 'grandparents_of_tom')`. This assumes that Tom's feeling towards his own grandparents is not relevant to the visit; instead, we infer that if Tom visits someone, it implies he has a positive feeling for them (in this case, those are his grandparents).

[USER] "John's father is the brother of his uncle." 
[EMBED] owns(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `related(Z, John_uncle).` and `father(Z, John_father)` where `John_uncle` and `John_father` are variables representing unspecified individuals. This implies that there is a common brother (or siblings) between John's uncle and his father. The exact relationship between the parties involved cannot be determined from the given sentence.

[EMBED] hates(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] LivesIn(Michael, LosAngeles)

To modify the given logical property `hates(X, Y)` related to the sentence "Michael lives in Los Angeles.", we would need additional information about relationships or feelings between characters. For example:

`LivesIn(michael, los_angeles), hates(michael, Z).`

This means that Michael lives in Los Angeles, and there is someone (Z) who Michael hates.

[USER] "Jane teaches at a university."

    grandparent(Individual1, Person),
    grandchild(Person, Individual2),
    sister(Individual1, Individual3),
    grandmother(Individual3, Person).`

This logical property represents that two individuals are related as a grandmother and granddaughter/grandson (Individual1 and Individual2) if Individual1 is a grandparent of Person (Individual2's parent), Individual1 is the sister of Individual3 (who is also Individual1's sibling), and Individual3 is the grandmother of Person. This property can be inferred from the sentence "John's grandmother is the sister of his great-grandmother" when applied to the appropriate individuals (such as John's paternal or maternal grandmothers).

[USER] "Rachel is employed by IBM." 
[EMBED] employed(X, Z). 
[GENERATE] `employed_by_IBM(rachel)`.

[GENERATE] `married(Jane, Colleague_of_Jane).`

[USER] "Alex lives in Paris." 
[EMBED] hates(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] LivesIn(Alex, Paris).

This new logical property indicates that Alex resides in Paris. It does not provide any information about hating or loving other entities, but it can be used as a fact in further reasoning about Alex's relationships to other individuals or places.

[USER] "Laura loves photography." 
[EMBED] loves(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] loves(Laura, photography)

[USER] "John has a pet bird." 
[EMBED] owns(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `pet(bird, john)` or more generally, `pets(john, X), species(X, 'bird')`. Here, the first statement implies that John owns a pet which is a bird (in this case, a pet bird). The second statement provides more detail, stating that the specific pet John has is of the species 'bird'.

[USER] "Sarah visits her friends." 
[EMBED] hates(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] Visits_Friends(Sarah)

[USER] "Tom has a sibling." 
[EMBED] sibling(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `has_sibling(Tom).`

[USER] "John's uncle is the brother of his cousin." 
[EMBED] owns(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `related(X, Y) :- uncle_of(X, Z), cousin_of(Z, Y).`

Here, I assume that there are already defined rules for `uncle_of/2` and `cousin_of/2`. This new rule `related/2` will hold true if X is the uncle of Z and Z is the cousin of Y.

[USER] "David teaches computer science at school." 
[EMBED] owns(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `teaches_subject(agent('David'), subject('computer science')) . at_location(agent('David'), location('school')).`
Here, I have used the 'agent', 'subject' and 'location' predicates to represent entities and their relationships in the sentence. The first rule, `teaches_subject/2`, represents that an agent teaches a subject. The second rule, `at_location/2`, indicates that an agent is at a specific location. These properties are more generalizable to other sentences involving agents, subjects, and locations.

[USER] "Emily owns an apartment." 
[EMBED] owns(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `owns('Emily', 'an apartment').`

[USER] "Michael prefers hiking."

[EMBED] owns(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `related_by_sister(John's_great_grandmother, John's_great_aunt).`

[USER] "Rachel is employed by Apple."

[GENERATE] `employed(Rachel, Apple).`

[GENERATE] `sibling(emily, Friend)` where 'Friend' represents Emily's specific friend who is her sibling in this context.

[USER] "Michael lives in New York." 
[EMBED] hates(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] LivesIn(Michael, NewYork)

Without more context or additional properties, it's not possible to relate "hates" to the given sentence directly. However, you could potentially create a new property like "LivesWith" that could help indirectly infer relationships, for example:

LivesWith(Michael, PersonX) if LivesIn(Michael, City) and hates(PersonX, Michael). But remember this is just a hypothetical assumption based on the provided information.

[USER] "Jane teaches at a high school." 
[EMBED] employed(X, Z). 
[GENERATE] `teaches_at_high_school(jane).`

[USER] "Alex owns an SUV." 
[EMBED] owns(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `owns('Alex', 'SUV')`

[USER] "Laura loves cooking." 
[EMBED] hates(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] loves(laura, cooking)

[USER] "John has a pet rabbit." 
[EMBED] owns(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `has_pet(john, rabbit)` or more specifically for your given format: `pets_of(john, rabbit)`.

[USER] "Sarah visits her parents." 
[EMBED] owns(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `visits(Sarah, Parents_of_Sarah)`. This assumes that the parents of Sarah are unique and can be represented as a single entity, 'Parents_of_Sarah'.

[USER] "Tom hates tennis." 
[EMBED] hates(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `hates(tom, tennis)`

[USER] "John's great-uncle is the brother of his cousin." 
[EMBED] owns(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] Based on the given sentence, we can infer that John's great-uncle and John's cousin share a parent (their common grandparent). This relationship can be represented in logic using the `ancestor` and `sibling` properties:

```
ancestor(John's_great_uncle, John). % John's great-uncle is an ancestor of John
ancestor(John's_cousin, John).  % John's cousin is also an ancestor of John (through a different line)

sibling(John's_great_uncle, John's_cousin). % John's great-uncle and John's cousin are siblings
```

However, this doesn't directly relate to the property `owns`. The sentence doesn't provide any information about ownership. If we want to create a relationship between the people in the sentence and an object (for example, a house), we would need additional information like "John's great-uncle owns the house" or "the house is owned by John's cousin". In that case, the modified logical property could be:

```
owns(John's_great_uncle, X).  % John's great-uncle owns something (X)
owns(John's_cousin, Y).       % John's cousin also owns something (Y)
```

But remember, these properties are based on assumptions about the sentence and don't necessarily represent the actual relationship between the people in real life.

[USER] "David owns a house." 
[EMBED] owns(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] owns(David, 'a house').

[USER] "Emily and her sister are siblings." 
[EMBED] sibling(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] sibling(emily, SISTER), where SISTER is a variable representing Emily's sister.

[USER] "Michael prefers skiing." 
[EMBED] prefers(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `prefers('Michael', 'skiing').`

[USER] "Jane can travel to Australia." 
[EMBED] can_travel(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `can_travel('Jane', 'Australia').`

[USER] "Alex is married to his friend." 
[EMBED] married(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `married(Alex, Friend_of_Alex).`

[USER] "Laura needs help with art." 
[EMBED] needs_help_with(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `needs_help_with('art', 'Laura').`

[USER] "John owns a bike." 
[EMBED] owns(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] owns(John, a_bike)

[USER] "Sarah loves playing basketball." 
[EMBED] loves(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `plays_basketball(sarah)` and `loves(sarah, basketball)`.

[USER] "Tom visits his friends." 
[EMBED] hates(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `likes(X, 'friends of Tom').`

Here's why: The original property `hates(X, Y)` is used to express that X hates Y. In the given sentence "Tom visits his friends," there's no mention of hate or dislike, but it does imply that Tom has a positive relationship with his friends. Therefore, we can create a new property `likes(X, 'friends of X')` to represent this positive relationship.

[USER] "John's great-grandfather is the brother of his grandfather." 
[EMBED] owns(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `related_by_brother(X, Y) . parent_relation(Z, X), grandparent_of(Z, J), X \= Z, parent_relation(W, Y), grandparent_of(W, J), W \= Z, brother(X, W) .`

This modified logical property states that there exists a relation of being brothers between two individuals (X and W), where both X and W are related to John as a parent or grandparent, but neither X nor W is the same as John's parent or grandparent. This represents the given sentence "John's great-grandfather is the brother of his grandfather."

[USER] "Rachel teaches at a university." 
[EMBED] employed(X, Z). 
[GENERATE] `teaches\_at\_university(Rachel)`.

[USER] "Emily and her colleague are siblings." 
[EMBED] sibling(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] sibling(emily, Colleague), where 'Colleague' is a variable representing Emily's colleague. This property states that Emily and her colleague are siblings.

[USER] "Michael lives in Los Angeles." 
[EMBED] hates(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] Lives_in(X, "Los Angeles").

This new property indicates that X (in this case Michael) lives in the city named Los Angeles. However, it doesn't provide any information about feelings or relationships like hating someone as per your original question.

[USER] "Jane is married to her friend." 
[EMBED] married(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `married(X, 'her friend').` (assuming we use a constant for Jane's friend) or `married(jane, Y), woman(Y), friendOf(jane, Y).` (if we want to keep variables and add conditions for the friend being female and friends with Jane)

[USER] "Alex owns an apartment." 
[EMBED] owns(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `owns('Alex', 'an Apartment').`

[USER] "Laura loves music."

[GENERATE] owns(john, 'parrot')

[GENERATE] visited_by(Y, Sarah)  // This represents that 'Y' (in this case, Sarah's cousins) is visited by Sarah.

[USER] "Tom hates swimming." 
[EMBED] hates(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `hates(tom, swimming)`
