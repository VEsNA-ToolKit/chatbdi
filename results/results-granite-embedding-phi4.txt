[USER] "John's mother is the sister of his aunt." 
[EMBED] parent(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] To modify the logical property `parent(X, Y)` based on the sentence "John's mother is the sister of his aunt," we need to define relationships that reflect these family connections:

1. John's mother (`mother(john)`) is a sibling to John's aunt.
2. The aunt in this context can be either the sister of John's father or the daughter of one of John's grandparents.

The logical properties capturing these relationships would be:

```prolog
sibling(X, Y) :- parent(Z, X), parent(Z, Y).
aunt(Y, john) :- sibling(X, mother(john)), parent(X, Y).

mother(john)'s_sister_is_aunt_of_john(Aunt) :- 
    mother(john)'s_sister(Sister),
    aunt(john, Aunt),
    Sister = Aunt.
    
mother(john)'s_sister(Sister) :- 
    sibling(mother(john), Sister).
```

Here, we have introduced `sibling/2` to capture the sibling relationship and defined how John's mother's sister connects as his aunt.

This modified logical property captures the relationship described in the sentence: "John's father is the brother of his uncle." It states that there exists a person \( Y \) who is the parent and male (father) of \( X \), and \( Y \) is a sibling to another person \( Z \). Furthermore, \( Z \) has a child \( W \), and \( W \) in turn is a parent of John. This setup reflects that \( X \) is John's uncle, whose brother (\( Y \)) is John's father.

```

This modification captures the relationships described in the sentence. It defines a `great_grandmother` as a grandparent of one's parent and a `sibling` as sharing at least one parent. Additionally, it specifies a `great_aunt` as an aunt or uncle of one's grandparent who is also a sibling of another individual.

[USER] "Sarah visits her parents." 
[EMBED] parent(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] ``` 
visits(sarah, parent_of_sarah).
``` 

This assumes there is an existing relationship or fact defined as `parent_of_sarah(X)` which identifies Sarah's parents as `X`. Alternatively, if specific names of Sarah's parents are known, those can be directly used:

```
visits(sarah, john) ∧ visits(sarah, jane).
``` 

These assume John and Jane are Sarah's parents.

[USER] "John's great-uncle is the brother of his cousin."

    sibling(W, Z),
    parent(V, W),
    parent(U, V),
    child(Y, U),
    not(parent(Y, Z)).
```

This logic captures the relationship where John's great-uncle is defined as the brother of his cousin. It outlines that there exists a parent-child chain from X to Y through several generations, with an intermediary sibling relationship connecting the great-uncle and one of those parents. The `not(parent(Y, Z))` condition ensures that the parent-child relationship does not loop directly between Y and Z, preserving the generational gap typical in a "great" relation.
