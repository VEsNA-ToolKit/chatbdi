This modified logical property represents that there exists a person Z who is:
1. A parent of John (Z = John's father or Z = John's mother)
2. A sibling of Aunt_of_John (Aunt_of_John shares the same parents as Z)
3. Female (since an aunt is always female)
4. The mother of Z (Since the sister of his/her aunt is actually his/her mother in this case).

In this modification, we introduce three new predicates: `uncle_of(Y, John)`, `father(X, Y)`, and `brother(X, Z)`. Here, we assume that a variable `John` represents the given name, and we use `Y` and `X` as other variables. The property states that there exists a person `Y` who is an uncle of `John`, and `Y`'s father (represented by variable `X`) is also the brother of `John's_father`.

[GENERATE] `taught_at_university(Z).`, `teaches(Y, Z).`, and `person(X)` can be inferred from the given sentence.

[GENERATE] `cousin_of(Sarah, X), parent_of(X, Z), sibling(Z, Y)`.

This new property infers that there exists a person (Y) who is Sarah's cousin, and that this person (Y) shares at least one parent (Z) with someone else (X), making them siblings. This logical property can be inferred from the sentence "Sarah visits her cousins" as it implies that Sarah has a family relationship with the people she's visiting, and those people are her cousins. The property `sibling(X, Y)` remains valid here but is now more specific to the context of the provided sentence.

- G2 is also the grandmother of John (John's grandmother)
- G3 and G4 are siblings since they are both sisters of the same person (G1 or G2)
- G1, G2, G3, and G4 are all individuals in this family tree.

[USER] "Tom has a sibling." 
[EMBED] sibling(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] child(Parent, Tom), sibling(Sibling, Tom) implies Parent \= Sibling. (Here, we assume that each person can have only one parent but multiple siblings.) This logical property represents that if Tom has a sibling Sibling, then their parent must be different (cannot be the same).

[USER] "John's uncle is the brother of his cousin." 
[EMBED] sibling(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `cousin_of(Z, John), uncle_of(Y, Z), brother(Y, X).`

Here, we have assumed 'John' as the known entity and introduced three new variables: Z (the cousin of John), Y (John's uncle), and X (the brother of John's uncle). The properties represent that 'Z' is the cousin of 'John', 'Y' is the uncle of 'Z', and 'X' is the brother of 'Y'. This setup reflects the given sentence.

[USER] "David teaches computer science at school."

[GENERATE] `ancestor_sister(Individual1, Individual2) :-
    ancestor(Individual1, John),
    female(Individual1),
    ancestor(John, Individual2),
    aunt(Individual2, John).`

Here, `ancestor_sister(Individual1, Individual2)` represents that Individual1 is the sister of Individual2 and they are both ancestors of John. The property also takes into account that a great-grandmother is an ancestor (in this case, Individual1), must be female, and that the great-aunt (Individual2) is an aunt of John (which means Individual2 is related to John through his parents).

[USER] "Tom hates tennis."

[USER] "John's great-uncle is the brother of his cousin." 
[EMBED] sibling(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `cousin(Z, John), uncle_of(W, Z), sibling(W, Y), grandfather(Y, John).`

Explanation:

* John's great-uncle is someone who is a grandchild of one of John's uncles (aunts).
* The brother of his cousin is someone who shares the same parent as John's cousin.

To express this in logic, we can use the following properties:

1. `cousin(Z, John)` means that Z is a cousin of John.
2. `uncle_of(W, Z)` means that W is an uncle (aunt) of Z.
3. `sibling(X, Y)` means that X and Y are siblings (brothers or sisters).
4. `grandfather(Y, John)` means that Y is a grandfather of John.

To express the given sentence "John's great-uncle is the brother of his cousin" in logic, we can use the above properties:

* Since John's great-uncle is someone who is a grandchild of one of John's uncles (aunts), we can say that there exists a person W such that `uncle_of(W, X)` and `grandfather(X, John)`.
* Since the brother of his cousin is someone who shares the same parent as John's cousin, we can say that there exists a person Z such that `cousin(Z, John)`, which means that there exists another person Y such that `sibling(Y, Z)`.
* Combining both statements, we can express "John's great-uncle is the brother of his cousin" as follows:
  1. There exists a person X such that `grandfather(X, John)` and `uncle_of(W, X)`.
  2. There exists another person Z such that `cousin(Z, John)`, which means there exists a person Y such that `sibling(Y, Z)`.

To make the property more concise, we can eliminate the intermediate variables W and X:

* Since there must be only one set of grandparents for John, we can say that the great-uncle who is also the brother of his cousin is the same person Y, who is a sibling of John's cousin Z.
* So, the modified logical property would be: `cousin(Z, John), uncle_of(Y, Z), sibling(Y, _)`. However, since we don't need to know the specific cousin of John, it's more appropriate to use an anonymous variable "_" instead of Y.

Finally, we can modify the property as follows: `cousin(Z, John), uncle_of(_, Z), sibling(_, _)`. This property states that there exists a person who is both John's cousin and the uncle (aunt) of another person, who in turn shares the same parent with an unknown individual.

In this property, we have assumed that both John's grandfather and his great-grandfather have unique names (e.g., John's_grandfather and John's_great_grandfather), and the relationships are defined as follows:

* `ancestor(X, Y)` means X is an ancestor of Y
* `parent(X, Y)` means X is a parent of Y
* `grandparent(X, Y)` means X is a grandparent of Y
* `brother(X, Y)` means X and Y are brothers (i.e., they share the same parents)

owns_pet('parrot_species', 'John').

[USER] "Sarah visits her cousins." 
[EMBED] sibling(X, Y). 
[GENERATE] `cousin_of(X, Sarah), parent(Z, X), sibling(Z, Y)`.

Explanation: This new property infers that if there is an individual (X) who is a cousin of Sarah, and X has a common parent (Z) with another individual (Y), then Y is a sibling of X. In this case, it implies that Sarah's cousins are related to her through shared parents (siblings).

[USER] "Tom hates swimming."
