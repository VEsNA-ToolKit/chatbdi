[USER] The calories for 100 grams of beef are 156.
[EMBEDDING] calories(veal, unit(50, gr), 81)
[GENERATE] calories(beef, unit(_, _), _)

Since we don't have specific details about grams or calorie count from the given sentence for beef (formerly veal) and there is no mention of a particular date associated with this information as in previous examples.
[SOLUTION] calories(beef, unit(100, gr), 156)

[USER] 100 gr of beef amount to 156 calories.
[EMBEDDING] calories(veal, unit(50, gr), 81)
[GENERATE] calories(beef, unit(_, _), _)

Since we do not have enough specific details about beef's calorie content per gram or any other numerical data from the given information to accurately modify the logical property for 'beef', I used placeholders with underscores.
[SOLUTION] calories(beef, unit(100, gr), 156)

[USER] There are 156 calories in 100 grams of beef.
[EMBEDDING] calories(veal, unit(50, gr), 81)
[GENERATE] calories(beef, unit(_, _), _)


Explanation: The original statement provided specific details about veal (a type of meat) but did not match with any information given in the new sentence which talks about beef without specifying a cut or part. Therefore, we replace 'veal' with '_', and since no unit is mentioned for calories per 100 grams nor do we have an exact number to fill into our logical property (as it differs from veal), both the value placeholder in `unit(50, _)` and `_` are replaced by underscores.
[SOLUTION] calories(beef, unit(100, gr), 156)

[USER] The calories for a serving portion of beef are 300.
[EMBEDDING] +calories(pasta(norma), unit(1, portion), 325)
[GENERATE] calories(beef(norma), unit(1, portion), _ )

[SOLUTION] calories(beef, unit(1, portion), 300)

[USER] One portion of beef gives 300 calories.
[EMBEDDING] +calories(pasta(norma), unit(1, portion), 325)
[GENERATE] calories(beef(norma), unit(1, portion), _ )

[SOLUTION] calories(beef, unit(1, portion), 300)

[USER] Beef gives 300 calories.
[EMBEDDING] +calories(pasta(norma), unit(1, portion), 325)
[GENERATE] calories(beef, unit(1, portion), _)

[SOLUTION] calories(beef, unit(_, _), 300)

[USER] The calories for 100 grams of budweiser are 41.
[EMBEDDING] calories(veal, unit(50, gr), 81)
[GENERATE] calories(veal, unit(_), _)

Since no specific details about calories or units for veal are mentioned in the given sentence, all values related to them remain as _ (underscores). The only information provided is regarding "budweiser," which does not pertain to the logical property of veal.
[SOLUTION] calories(budweiser, unit(100, gr), 41)

[USER] The calories for one glass of budweiser are 100.
[EMBEDDING] calories(veal, unit(50, gr), 81)
[GENERATE] calories(veal, unit(_), _)

Since no specific details about calories for veal are mentioned in the given sentence and it only provides a comparison with beer's caloric content, we cannot infer any changes to the logical property related to 'veal'. Therefore, all original elements remain unchanged except that since there is nothing provided regarding unit or value of calories specifically about veal from this context, they are replaced by underscores.
[SOLUTION] calories(budweiser, unit(1, glass), 100)

[USER] Breadsticks are really caloric, they give 279 calories per 100 grams!

[USER] There are some food that give 600 calories.
[EMBEDDING] calories(veal, unit(50, gr), 81)
[GENERATE] calories(veal, unit(_), _)

Since there's no specific food or its calorie content mentioned about veal in the given sentence, I have replaced both values with _ (underscores). The modified logical property now reflects that we don't know if 'veal', and whether it gives 50 gr of unit as originally stated.
[SOLUTION] calories(_, unit(_, _), _)

[USER] Cabbage is great in diet, it only gives 61 calories per portion!
