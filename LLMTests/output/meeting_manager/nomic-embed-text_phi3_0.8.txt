[USER] Today I will have lunch with my family
[EMBEDDING] event(lunch(family, where("pizza restaurant")), today)

[EMBEDDING] event(meeting(mario, on(zoom)), date(15, 1, 2025))

[USER] I want to reserve a table for my family at "Bagel Palace" for tonight
[EMBEDDING] event(dinner(family, where("home")), tomorrow)
[GENERATE] event(dinner(family, where("Bagel Palace")), _ )  # The time was not specified in the given sentence. Therefore it's replaced with an underscore (_). Other modifications are unnecessary as no specific information about date or order is mentioned. No direct quotes should be used for this modification and only plain text characters (no backticks) are acceptable, hence 'tomorrow' becomes '_'.
[SOLUTION] event(dinner(family, "Bagel Palace"), tonight)

[USER] I will be on holiday from the 12th of January to the 16th of January
[EMBEDDING] free(Date)
[GENERATE] free(_, _ , _, _) because no specific dates or values are mentioned in the given sentence for this temporal logic statement concerning free time.
[SOLUTION] out_of_office(date(12, 1, _), date(16, 1, _))

[USER] Set on my calendar that tomorrow I am free
[EMBEDDING] free(Date)
[GENERATE] modified_logical_property: free(Date) where Date = _tomorrow_
[SOLUTION] free(tomorrow)

[USER] Today I am busy and I cannot come to the office
[EMBEDDING] out_of_office(date(X), date(Y))
[GENERATE] out_of_office(_, _)

Since no specific date or time was mentioned within the given sentence about being busy and unable to come into work today, we are left with variables for both dates which leads us to have two blanks as they're yet undefined from the context.
[SOLUTION] busy(today)

[USER] I have to meet a person online on zoom tomorrow
[EMBEDDING] event(meeting(mario, on(zoom)), date(15, 1, 2025))
[GENERATE] logical_property: event(meeting(mario, _on(zoom)), date(__, _tomorrow))

[SOLUTION] event(meeting(_, on(zoom)), tomorrow)

[USER] Today is the 15th of January 2025, starting tomorrow I will be on holiday for a week
[EMBEDDING] busy(date(21, 2, 2024))
[GENERATE] busy(date(_, _, _))```, where each blank represents one of the three elements (day, month, year) that are missing from the logical property and were referred to by the information not contained in the sentence: "_", "_", "2025".
[SOLUTION] out_of_office(date(12, 1, 2025), date(19, 1, 2025))

[USER] Today I will have lunch with my family but tonight I have to work and I do not want to be bothered
[EMBEDDING] event(lunch(family, where("pizza restaurant")), today)

[SOLUTION] event(lunch(family, _), today), busy(tonight)
