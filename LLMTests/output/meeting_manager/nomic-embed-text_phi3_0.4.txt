[USER] Today I will have lunch with my family
[EMBEDDING] event(lunch(family, where("pizza restaurant")), today)
[GENERATE] event(lunch(family, where(_)), _)
[SOLUTION] event(lunch(family, where(_)), today)

[USER] Tomorrow I have a meeting with Pippo on Zoom
[EMBEDDING] event(meeting(mario, on(zoom)), date(15, 1, 2025))
[GENERATE] event(meeting(tomorrow_mario_pippo, on(zoom)), date(_))

Explanation: The given sentence does not provide a specific date for tomorrow's meeting with Pippo (Tom), so I filled in that part of the logical property with an underscore.
[SOLUTION] event(meeting(pippo, on(zoom)), tomorrow)

[USER] Please, take note that I have a meeting on Teams with Carla on the 25th of August 2025
[EMBEDDING] event(meeting(Who, on(Where)), date(Day, Month, Year))
[GENERATE] event(meeting(Carla, on("Teams")), date(_, "August", 2025))


Explanation: From the given logical property and sentence, we extract that there's a meeting with Carla happening (assuming 'meeting' refers to an event). The location is specified as Teams. Although not explicitly mentioned in terms of date format or day numbering system used by Prolog predicates, since it was provided without specificity regarding the numeric representation and assuming we are using standard American English convention where "the 25th" implies a numerical value for days (e.g., 'day' refers to `Day` in our logical property), I have represented August as `"August"` because that is what Prolog would likely expect, but without explicit day numbering provided by the sentence; hence it remains an underscore `_`. The year 2025 was directly mentioned and thus included.
[SOLUTION] event(meeting(carla, on(teams)), date(25, 8, 2025))

[USER] I want to reserve a table for my family at "Bagel Palace" for tonight
[EMBEDDING] event(dinner(family, where("home")), tomorrow)
[GENERATE] event(dinner(family, where("_")), _)

Explanation: The name "Bagel Palace" was added as a new location for dinner (where(_)), and since it's happening tonight instead of tomorrow, we replace "_" with the word night.
[SOLUTION] event(dinner(family, "Bagel Palace"), tonight)

[USER] I will be on holiday from the 12th of January to the 16th of January
[EMBEDDING] free(Date)
[GENERATE] free(Date) = _ , Date = "1/12/2023" to "_", Date = "1/16/2023"
[SOLUTION] out_of_office(date(12, 1, _), date(16, 1, _))

[USER] Set on my calendar that tomorrow I am free
[EMBEDDING] free(Date)
[GENERATE] Logical property: free(tomorrow)
[SOLUTION] free(tomorrow)

[USER] Today I am busy and I cannot come to the office
[EMBEDDING] out_of_office(date(X), date(Y))
[GENERATE] out_of_office(X, _)

[SOLUTION] busy(today)

[USER] I have to meet a person online on zoom tomorrow
[EMBEDDING] event(meeting(mario, on(zoom)), date(15, 1, 2025))
[GENERATE] event(meeting(mario, _), date(_))
[SOLUTION] event(meeting(_, on(zoom)), tomorrow)

[USER] Today is the 15th of January 2025, starting tomorrow I will be on holiday for a week
[EMBEDDING] busy(date(21, 2, 2024))
[GENERATE] busy(date(__, _))


Explanation: Since no specific date or time was mentioned regarding being busy within the provided context, both elements are replaced with underscores to indicate missing information. The year has also changed from "2024" in the logical property to "2025", as indicated by the sentence's reference to dates beyond 2024.
[SOLUTION] out_of_office(date(12, 1, 2025), date(19, 1, 2025))

[USER] Today I will have lunch with my family but tonight I have to work and I do not want to be bothered
[EMBEDDING] event(lunch(family, where("pizza restaurant")), today)
[GENERATE] event(lunch(family, where(_)), _)

Since no specific details about today's lunch time or location are provided in the given sentence, I have used underscores to denote missing information for both 'today' and 'where'. The meal is specified as pizza but not explicitly mentioned that it will be had with family. However, since they plan on having lunch together according to context of "Today I will have...", the logical property remains largely unchanged except omitting explicit mentioning about today which can also imply any day and 'where' without specific details from sentence hence underscores are used there too.
[SOLUTION] event(lunch(family, _), today), busy(tonight)
